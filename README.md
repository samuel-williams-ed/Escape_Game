## Brief
To learn C# & Unity in order to build a desktop game that we would want to play ourselves. To be designed as the first chapter of a larger story, the game should:
- be a 3D first-person escape room style game where the player has free movement to explore the room;
- allow interaction with key objects in the room that focuses the player's view and allows further interactions with objects / puzzles;
- contain collectable items that are available in an on-screen inventory once collected;
- deliver narrative / clues to the player via a dynamic on-screen dialogue box;
- have a start menu and end credits.
<br>
Within the timeframe of the project, we were also able to incorporate additional dialogue prompts for non-key objects; background music and some effects at the start of the game.
<br>

### Future Plans
Whilst we're really proud of how much we achieved in such a short time, there's still so much we would love to expand on in this game. Potential future work includes:
- improving the player experience by adding a guide to player controls, a button for optional hints, a pause menu and a 'Play Again' button at the end of the credits;
- increasing interactions with objects (e.g. including small movements in non-key objects when investigated) and complexity of the puzzles (e.g. a slider to "tune" the radio);
- make the dialogue links flow better ("stack" dialogue from clicks) and incorporate different dialogue when the same object is clicked multiple times;
- and of course develop Chapter 2: The Quaternion Cave!!

<!-- ## Play the Game
The game can be played at [Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/).
<br>
If you would prefer to download the game to play it, you can clone this repository and, within the play_game folder, open either the windows or mac build depending on your operating system.
<br>

### Controls
W,A,S,D or Arrow keys: Move forward, left, back, right respectively. <br>
Space bar: Jump. <br>
Mouse movement: In main room, cursor is locked and movement makes the player look around. When focused on a specific object, cursor is not locked and can be freely moved to investigate objects in view. <br>
Left mouse click: Investigate an object, including selecting an object from the inventory. Note, whem the player has free movement the cursor is locked to the white reticle in the centre of the screen. <br>
Right mouse click: Will auto-complete any dialogue currently being output.
